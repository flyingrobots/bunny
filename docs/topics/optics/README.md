# Optics

This chapter defines Bunny's current contract for camera and ray-generation
math in `bunny-optics`: a deterministic pinhole camera that turns pixel
samples into [trace rays](../ray-tracing/README.md).

## Status

This is a living topic chapter, not a proposal.

Current behavior is implemented in `crates/bunny-optics/src` and exported as:

- `PinholeCamera` (`new`, `ray`, `position`, `forward`, `right`, `up`,
  `tan_half_fov`, `width`, `height`, `scale_shift`);
- `CameraSpec`, the camera's inputs;
- `PixelSample` (`new`, `centre`);
- `CameraError`;
- `point_at`;
- `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION` and `TAN_HALF_FOV_LIMIT_RAW`.

Evidence is listed in the [test plan](test-plan.md). Sampling sequences
(flyingrobots/bunny#221) and shading or pixel values (#222, #160) are not part
of this chapter. The camera uses the same conventions as `FixedMat4::try_look_at`
(right-handed, `right = forward x up`), `FixedMat4::try_perspective` (vertical
field of view given by its tangent, aspect `width / height`) and `Viewport`
(top-left origin, `y` down), but no test yet checks a ray against those
matrices; that is an open gap in the test plan.

All arithmetic is integer arithmetic on raw Q32.32 values (`i64`, widened to
`i128`). There is no floating point, no trigonometry, no `unsafe` code and no
target-specific path. The camera's part of generating a ray takes no square
root and no division: six `i128` multiplications, additions and shifts. The
`TraceRay::new` call that follows computes the ray's three reciprocals, as for
any trace ray.

## Inputs

A `CameraSpec` holds:

| Field | Meaning | Accepted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | The eye point and origin of every ray. | Inside the trace domain: every `abs(raw) < 2^40` (below 256 units). |
| `look` | The viewing direction, any length. | Nonzero. |
| `up` | A hint that fixes the roll, any length. | Nonzero and not within about `2^-16` of parallel to `look`. |
| `tan_half_fov` | The tangent of half the vertical field of view. | `0 < tan <= 256.0` (`TAN_HALF_FOV_LIMIT_RAW = 2^40`). |
| `width`, `height` | The image size in pixels; their ratio is the aspect ratio. | `1..=32768` each (`MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION = 2^15`). |

The field of view is given by its tangent so that no trigonometry is needed: a
caller with an angle converts it once, at the boundary. A tangent of 1.0 is a
90-degree vertical field of view.

## Construction

`PinholeCamera::new` checks its inputs in this order and returns the first
error:

1. a position coordinate outside the trace domain:
   `PositionOutsideTraceDomain`;
2. a zero width or height: `EmptyImage`; one above 32768: `ImageTooLarge`;
3. a zero or negative tangent: `TangentNotPositive`; one above 256.0:
   `TangentTooLarge`;
4. a zero look direction: `ZeroLook`;
5. a zero up hint: `UpParallelToLook`;
6. an up hint parallel or nearly parallel to the look direction, meaning
   every component of `unit(look) x unit(up)` is below `2^16` raw units (the
   sine of the angle between them is below about `2^-16`): `UpParallelToLook`;
7. a basis vector that `FixedUnitVec3::new` fails to normalize, or no
   direction scale that fits (see below): `Unrepresentable`. This is a
   defensive refusal; no accepted input is known to reach it.

Look and up vectors of any nonzero length are accepted, from one raw unit to
the full Q32.32 range: each vector is scaled by a power of two before it is
normalized (see Camera Frame), so its length can neither overflow nor be too
short for `FixedUnitVec3::new` to normalize. That is why there is no overflow
error.

## Camera Frame

The camera derives a right-handed unit basis from `look` and `up`, using
`FixedVec3::cross` and `FixedUnitVec3::new`:

```text
forward     = unit(look)
side        = forward x unit(up)            // all components < 2^16 raw: UpParallelToLook
first_right = unit(side)
up          = unit(first_right x forward)
right       = unit(forward x up)
```

Here `unit(v)` is `FixedUnitVec3::new` applied to `v` scaled by the power of
two that puts its largest component magnitude in `[2^61, 2^62)`. Scaling up
is exact; scaling down floors each component, and only the direction matters.
`FixedUnitVec3::new` on its own refuses many vectors much shorter than one
unit, because its floored length loses relative precision. A side vector of
length 0.18 misses the unit-length check by two raw units, for example, and
about one random up hint in twenty would be refused. The prescale removes
that.

So `right = forward x up` and `forward = up x right`, the right-hand rule of
[the coordinate law](../coordinate-law/README.md). A camera looking down `-Z`
with up `+Y` has right `+X`: its image is the canonical `XY` view, with `+X`
right and `+Y` up. The camera's up is the part of the hint orthogonal to
`forward`, on the hint's side.

The second round of cross products starts from two nearly orthogonal unit
vectors, so the basis is orthogonal to a few raw units even when the hint is
nearly parallel to `look`. The test plan checks every pairwise dot product
below `2^36` raw-squared units, a cosine below `2^-28`.

## Image Convention

The image is a rectangle on the plane one unit ahead of the position, centred
on `forward`. It spans `-tan..=tan` along `up` and
`-tan * width / height..=tan * width / height` along `right`; pixels are
square.

- **Origin.** Pixel `(0, 0)` is the top-left pixel.
- **Columns.** `x` counts from the left edge and grows toward `right`.
- **Rows.** `y` counts from the top edge and grows toward `-up`, downward.
- **Sub-pixel offsets.** A `PixelSample` names pixel `(x, y)` and an offset
  `(sub_x, sub_y)` in `[0, 1)` on each axis, as Q32.32 fractions, measured
  rightward and downward from the pixel's top-left corner.
  `PixelSample::centre` uses one half on both axes, the pixel centre.

This is the convention of the coordinate law's
[viewport conversion](../coordinate-law/README.md#viewport-conversion) and of
`bunny_linalg::Viewport`: origin at the top-left corner, pixel `y` running
down, pixel `i` spanning `[i, i + 1)`. A sample's continuous viewport
coordinate is exactly `(x + sub_x, y + sub_y)`, and rows come out in the order
image buffers store them.

The sample's point on the image rectangle is, relative to the position,

```text
P = forward + a * (tan / height) * right + b * (tan / height) * up
a = 2 * (x + sub_x) - width
b = height - 2 * (y + sub_y)
```

where `a` and `b` are the doubled offsets from the image centre in pixels.
Both are exact in Q32.32 for every sample.

## Ray Generation

`PinholeCamera::ray(sample)` returns a `TraceRay` from the position toward the
sample's point, or `None` when the sample is outside the image: `x >= width`,
`y >= height`, or a sub-pixel offset outside `[0, 1)`. It is a pure function
of the camera and the sample.

Construction stores three `i128` vectors in fine units of `2^-64` and a scale
shift `k` (with `F`, `R`, `U` the raw basis and `T` the raw tangent):

```text
centre_i = F_i * 2^32 >> k                       // exact for k <= 32
step_x_i = floor(2 * T * R_i / (height * 2^k))   // change per pixel along x
step_y_i = floor(2 * T * U_i / (height * 2^k))   // change per pixel along y
```

and each direction component is the floor of one exact expression:

```text
d_i = floor((centre_i * 2^33 + a_raw * step_x_i + b_raw * step_y_i) / 2^65)
```

with `a_raw` and `b_raw` the raw Q32.32 values of `a` and `b`. The division by
`2^65` is an arithmetic shift, so the floor is toward negative infinity. Every
rounding in ray generation is a floor.

## Direction Scaling

The direction is not normalized; that is what keeps square roots and divisions
out of the per-ray path. Instead every direction is `2^-k` times the sample's
image-plane offset `P`, and `k` is chosen once, at construction, so that every
component of every direction is at most 1.0 in magnitude, as
`TraceRay::new` requires.

**The rule.** `k` is the smallest value in `0..=32` for which the four corner
directions of the image rectangle (`a = +-width`, `b = +-height`, computed with
the formula above) have every component in `-1.0..=1.0`, inclusive.

**Why the corners are enough.** For a fixed camera, the expression inside the
floor is an affine function of `(a_raw, b_raw)`. An affine function on a
rectangle takes its largest and smallest values at the rectangle's corners,
and the floor is monotone, so each `d_i` over the whole rectangle lies between
its values at the corners. Every sample has `-width <= a < width` and
`-height <= b < height`, inside the closed rectangle. So if the corners fit,
every sample of every pixel fits.

**Why a fitting `k` always exists.** Each basis component is at most 1.0, so
each component of `P` is at most `1 + tan * (width + height) / height` in
magnitude, which is below `1 + 256 * (2^15 + 1) < 2^24` for every accepted
camera. At `k = 24` the exact corner values are below `1 - 2^-24` units, and
rounding adds at most `(width + height) / 2^33` raw units, so the corners fit.
The search therefore always succeeds by `k = 24`; the most extreme accepted
cameras (tangent 256.0, a 32768 by 1 image) need `k = 23`.

**Forward-facing directions.** Construction also checks that each corner
direction `d` has `d . F > 2 * |F|_1` (raw `i128` arithmetic). Because
`d . F` is within `|F|_1` of an affine function of the sample, this makes
`d . F > 0` for every sample, so no direction is zero and every ray points
ahead of the camera. The check passes with a wide margin for every camera the
tests construct; failing it would return `Unrepresentable`.

**Precision.** Halving the direction for wide images or fields of view costs
one bit of each component per halving. A 90-degree 16:9 camera has `k = 1`;
the widest accepted field of view at the largest square image has `k = 8` or
`9`, depending on the look direction.

## Accuracy

Let `S_i` be component `i` of `2^-k * P` in raw units, computed exactly from
the camera's stored basis, tangent and image size. Then

```text
S_i - 1 - (width + height) / 2^33  <  d_i  <=  S_i + (width + height) / 2^33
```

raw units. The final floor contributes the one raw unit below; flooring the
two steps contributes less than `(width + height) / 2^33` raw units in either
direction, which is at most `2^-17` raw units for every accepted image. In other
words: the ray reaches, at distance `2^k`, a point within
`2^k * (1 + 2^-17)` raw units of the intended image-plane point on each axis.

The intended point is defined with the stored basis, which is unit length and
orthogonal only up to its own rounding (see Camera Frame).

## Distances Along A Ray

Because directions are not unit length, a trace distance `t` (from
`TraceRay::box_entry` or `TriangleHit::distance`) is a multiple of that ray's
direction, and rays through different pixels have different direction lengths.
Distances from different rays are therefore not comparable as Euclidean
lengths. What a renderer can rely on:

- **The hit point.** `point_at(ray, t)` returns `origin + direction * t`. Each
  product is rounded to nearest with ties to even (the Q32.32 multiplication
  rule of the [numeric constitution](../../NUMERIC_CONSTITUTION.md)) and the sum
  is exact; it returns `None` when a coordinate is not representable. With the
  floored distance of `TriangleHit`, the point is on the camera's side of the
  surface by less than one raw unit of distance times the direction, plus the
  product rounding.
- **Depth along the view axis.** The forward component of every direction is
  `2^-k` before rounding, so `t * 2^-k` is, up to the accuracy bound and the
  basis rounding, the hit's depth along `forward`. That depth is comparable
  across pixels; it is not computed by this crate.
- **Euclidean distance.** `t * |direction|`, which needs a square root per ray;
  a caller that needs it computes it with `FixedVec3::length`.

## Accepted Limits

| Limit | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image width and height | `1..=32768` | Keeps the step rounding at most `2^-17` raw units and every intermediate below `2^123` in `i128`; covers 16K images (15360 by 8640). |
| Tangent of half the vertical field of view | `(0, 256.0]` | 256.0 is a vertical field of view just below 179.56 degrees. With it, a step at `k = 0` is below `2^73` fine units, so each product in the direction formula stays below `2^121`. |
| Position | `abs(raw) < 2^40` | The trace domain of `TraceRay::new`. |
| Scale shift | `0..=32` | The centre vector `F * 2^32 >> k` is exact up to 32; accepted cameras need at most 24. |

Narrow fields of view are accepted down to a tangent of one raw unit. The ray
is still exact to the bound above, but the per-pixel step can shrink below one
raw unit of direction, so neighbouring pixels may share a ray.
